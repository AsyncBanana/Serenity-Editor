# Contributing

## Setting up the repo

First, clone the repository to your local development device:

```
 git clone https://github.com/AsyncBanana/Serenity-Editor 
 ```

Then, install dependencies and initialize the repository

```
 npm i 
 ```

You can start the dev server using

```
 npm start 
 ```

From there, navigate to `localhost:3000` and you should see the landing page.

## Committing Changes

Adding something is pretty typical for Serenity. Just make a fork, commit your changes to the fork, and make a Pull Request. If there is a relevant issue, mention the issue inside the Pull Request description.
