# Serenity Editor

Serenity Editor is a light, fast web and desktop text editor with support for markdown shorcuts, wysiwyg editing, exporting to markdown/html, and more. I created it as a replacement for editors like Google Docs, because they are clunky and do not support markdown.

# Features

- 🪶Light, with a >5 MB installation size, and installation-less web app.

- 🚀Fast and able to handle large text, with more optimization like multi threaded editing coming soon

- 🔰Simple and intuitive

- 🗒️Built in support for markdown and html exporting



# Using

Currently this can be used through the github release, or in the web app.
